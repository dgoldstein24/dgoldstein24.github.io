This article explains the booming field of machine learning with an eye towards the layperson/business leader. The article primarily focuses on classification and breaks down the process into Representation, Evaluation, and Optimization. Representation refers to the computer code that establishes that a machine learning process is conducted. Evaluation references the ability to discern whether a machine learning program performs classification well, usually with the standards of accuracy and efficiency (memory and time conservation). Lastly, optimization represents that the idea that good machine learning programs can be made better by tuning them to their ideal settings. When all three of these components are done well, they can be used to separate the “good” from the “bad” in various business fields i.e. the stock market.

The article also gets one of the core concepts of machine learning: generalization. The idea is to train the model to accurately predict the outputs of known results so that the model can then be applied more generally to data whose classification is not yet known. The article also stresses the importance of domain expertise in the application of machine learning: in order to ensure the best results, one must have an in-depth understanding of the subject at-hand. This phenomenon manifests itself in the proper selection of features for input into the machine learning program, the correct tuning of the function, and the necessary understanding of whether the results of the program actually answer the question being asked. For example, I recently used machine learning to classify NBA players as All-NBA selections. My machine learning model was 98% correct, but I knew I had to change my model when I noticed that the model predicted every player as not All-NBA. To figure out which players would have breakout seasons, I had to change my standard for a “good” machine learning model. The article does a good job of conveying similar notions of how the actionable use of machine learning depends on more than just an accurate model.

The article also stresses the point that machine learning programs do not compensate for a lack of data. The more data there is available, then the better the model will be. Quality and quantity of data increases the ceiling in terms of potential actionable use of data: the use of machine learning can then help one to approach the ceiling of that potential. It is essential that business leaders understand this concept: hiring a machine learning expert does not excuse an avoidance of purchasing data: the latter is necessary to take full advantage of the former.
