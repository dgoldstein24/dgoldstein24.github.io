This article introduces the basics of deep learning through the use of neural networks. In particular, it focuses on the application of this area of data science to mathematics, but many of the points are relevant to the business world. For one, an industry is arising for companies that provide more efficient, accurate systems and coding patterns for this type of statistical modeling. In addition, many companies in the technology sector have focused on improving graphics processing units’ capacity in order to keep pace with the advances that deep learning has allowed for in image processing. This is one area in which neural networks show a tremendous amount of progress, for one of its primary applications is to take unstructured data and find the undefined relationships between its subcomponents and group them into patterns. In other words, the color of one pixel does not inherently relate to the color of an adjacent pixel, but over several examples certain pixels tend to be near others. Deep learning allows for computers to pick up on these tendencies. This technology is crucial to the usage of facial recognition technology that has major business implications, i.e. security for the live events and entertainment industry.

An important aspect of CNN’s that the article explains is the idea of back propagation to adjust weights and biases in order to minimize loss. In laymen’s terms, after a CNN goes through a cycle of computations leading to an output, it works backwards to check whether the assumptions it made during the computation process should be tweaked. Although some parameters must be manually tuned, one of the areas of promise for this type of modeling is its capacity for self-correction. The article also goes into some of the downsides of CNN. A few of the most notable ones are the great computational needs (time and memory) of using neural networks and how it can be quite unclear how exactly the CNN makes its intermediate decisions, even if the results are promising. Overall, a business leader can interpret the article in the following way: deep learning has already penetrated industries that can utilize image processing, and further applications will arise as this relatively new field is supported by further research and enhanced computing.
